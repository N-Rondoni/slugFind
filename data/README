This immediate folder is populated with ground truth data,
dataset.status.calcium.csv e.g., 1.test.calcium.csv contains ground truth calcium values used in the spikefinder challenge. 
dataset.status.spikes.csv e.g., 1.test.spikes.csv contains simultaneously recorded ground truth spikes  used in spikefinder challenge.


dataPrep.py simply stores the columns of this ground truth data (neurons) as individual files, for example
node0_dset1.test.calcium.npy  would correspond to node 0 of test dataset 1, calcium recordings.
This is done for easier processing downstream and reduced memory overhead (no need to load in neurons whose data we aren't working with.)
These are saved in processed.

stm and friedrich contain the resultant estimated spikes from the algorithms stm and oasis. These
are used for comparison to the mpc approach's inferred spiking times.

paramEstimation contains the parameters estimated by the auto-calibration functionality of this softwares implementation.


processed also contains the folder solutions, in which spiking signals are stored by the mpc approach.
For example, processed/solutions/node0_dset1.test.sVals.npy 
contains the inferred spiking times via mpc from node 0, test dataset 1.
